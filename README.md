Hello! Welcome to my CASI MATS application repository. This is a compact, folder of the work I did for the application: experiments, notes, literature synthesis, and a short brain dump for next steps.

If you’re reading this, thanks for taking a look, I hope you find the writing clear and the experiments reproducible. Feedback, corrections, or pointers to related work are always welcome.
